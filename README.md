# tab-selection
Our project involves creating a tab section that includes numerous tabs, each with a title and corresponding text.
When you click on a tab, the title will be changed accordingly. We will also add an elegant hovering effect to each tab, and when a user selects a tab, its background color will change.
To implement this, we will use JavaScript to dynamically update the content.
We will style the tabs and create the hovering effect using CSS and the :hover pseudo-class to apply different styles when the user hovers over each tab.
